# bubble_world
A 2D world with cute bubbles that has two **fundamental principles**:

- *Conservation of momentum*
- *Conservation of energy*

And some other features:
- *Uniform areal density*
- *No loss of mechanical energy*
- *bubbles and the edges of the world are absolute rigid*
- *Uniform force field supported*

Might be useful to demonstrate the laws of mechanical motion.

Load your own config file to create a bubble_world and watch the interesting interaction of the creatures!

The color of a bubble implies its energy, for examlpe, a stationary bubble is totally black because its RGB color value is #000000. 

The total energy of the whole world is computed and shown real-time.

### 泡泡世界的起源
实习课见前桌玩起老电脑的泡泡屏保，写了这个小玩意杀时间（我们确实要被无聊的实习逼疯了...）

在一周的摸鱼中慢慢完善，最后居然意外的有趣
